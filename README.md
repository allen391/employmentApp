# employmentApp

### Project desc
This is a simple social networking chat application developed with React, Redux, and React Router. To enhance my react knowledge, I desired to develop an app to showcase the ability to React development, and also seek for employment opportunity. To simplify the project, I utilized the Antd-mobile UI framework to reduce the workload of CSS. In addition, this project is full-stack development with ExpressJS, MongoDB as well as React.
